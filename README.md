# Phase-IV Computer Science II (Python) Course Project

	Coach AI is a sports management company which purpose is assisting basketball front offices and coaching staff with analyzing and tracking the game.
  Because of this, the team at Coach AI are developing a software program designed to curate and assist in management/coaching decisions. 
  This tool can be used by employees track various statistics of all players on a basketball team and make recommendations based on said data. 
  This program can be and is encouraged to be used by multiple people on the staff. This program is used as a organizing tool and must be routinely filled out, in a text file, in order to get the most accurate outcomes. 
  This program should be used as a supplement toward any decisions as the program can only predict outcomes based on what’s trackable on the court (points, FG%, plus/minuses…).
  
  This program is to be used by any coaching/FO staff. This tool should have a simple and clean UI for quick accessibility. Users will be greeted to a menu with a set number of options to chose from. Users can go to the roster and read the record file, as well as add/edit/remove player info. Users can also able to sort and search players based on stats being tracked. Each change will alter the text file.
